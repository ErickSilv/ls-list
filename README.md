# ls::list

Implementation of class ls::list based on ADT list doubly linked list.
	
#Definition

We define a general linear list as the set of n ≥ 0 elements A[0], A[1], A[2], . . . , A[n − 1]. We say
that the size of the list is n and we call a list with size n = 0 an empty list. The structural properties
of a list comes, exclusively, from the relative position of its elements:
- if n > 0, A[0] is the first element,
- for 0 < k ≤ n, the element A[k − 1] precedes A[k].

Therefore, the first element of a list is A[0] and the last element is A[n − 1]. The position of
element A[i] in a list is i.

In onther ways, this project had as objective get the knowledge about doubly linked list, because this ls::list is a copy of the implementation of the ADT std::list (default C++).
